                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    Long ago, three heroes—<strong>Lucius</strong>, <strong>Myranda</strong>, and <strong>Gustav</strong>—faced the God of Destruction (GoD) at Babel Tower. They failed to defeat it. Instead, their souls were consumed and turned into the energy GoD now feeds on to destroy Azure from within.
                </p>

                <h3>A Humble Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    Generations later, in a small village at the edge of Minar, a young dreamer from a humble family inherits the legacy of those who once fought. After the death of his grandfather, he discovers a secret basement containing his father's armor and sword, relics from the old wars.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A spectral echo of his grandfather's voice whispers: <em>"Never belittle your dreams. The blood of courage has long awaited to awaken within you."</em>
                </p>

                <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
                <p>
                    Donning the old armor, the young knight sets forth from his home. His sibling bids farewell, handing him a small Azure charm: <em>"When the world starts to fall apart, let this stone remind you of home."</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And so begins the journey of the <strong>Azure Knight</strong>—the one who dares to dream under a fractured sky.

                <h3>The Myth of Creation</h3>
                <p>
                    Before the first dawn, there was only stillness—a silence so vast that it carried no concept of time. Then, within that void, a single vibration stirred. It was not a sound, but a pulse of will. From that vibration, light bloomed—a light that thinkers of the modern age call the <strong>Celestial Flame</strong>, the first and purest source of Azure energy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Celestial Flame was consciousness itself: it thought, dreamed, and in its dreaming, the universe unfolded. When the Flame cooled, fragments of its divine body drifted through the void. Nine of those fragments fell upon the same world and buried themselves deep beneath its newborn oceans and mountains. From them arose the <strong>Nine Azure Monuments</strong>, crystalline spires of immense beauty and power.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That world became known as <strong>Minar</strong>. The Monuments formed its spiritual organs, regulating the rhythm of wind, stone, tide, and life. Every creature inherited a spark of Azure within its being—a living echo of the Celestial Flame known as the <strong>Azure Core</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>The Celestial War and Birth of GoD</h3>
                <p>
                    The Celestials—beings born from the original Flame—were not gods as mortals imagine. They were intelligences of frequency, self-aware aspects of the Flame's own divided will. Among them were the <strong>Harmonists</strong>, who sought to preserve creation through unity, and the <strong>Dissonants</strong>, who believed destruction was the truest form of renewal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Their disagreement tore the heavens apart. From the deepest fracture of that war emerged a new being—something the Flame itself could not contain. It was hunger given purpose, silence given shape. It called itself <strong>GoD</strong>, the God of Destruction.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box warning">
                    <h4>⚠️ The Nature of GoD</h4>
                    <p>
                        GoD devours resonance itself. It finds nourishment not in matter, but in meaning—consuming the very vibrations that define life. Where GoD walks, Azure dims, and the music of the world falls silent.

                <h3>The Fall of the Three Heroes</h3>
                <p>
                    To stop GoD, the Harmonists wove a desperate seal using the nine Monuments. The ritual required mortal conduits—beings capable of suffering, of dying, of carrying will through chaos. Thus were born the Three Heroes of the First Era: <strong>Lucius</strong>, bearer of the Flame of Valor; <strong>Myranda</strong>, the Voice of Mercy; and <strong>Gustav</strong>, the Shield of the World.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the final battle at <strong>Babel Tower</strong>, they reached the summit where the Monument of Origin stood dormant. But in their moment of hesitation, GoD's mind whispered to them, revealing that their sacrifice would feed oblivion, not salvation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lucius faltered first, his courage tainted by doubt. Myranda, seeing his fear, tried to shield him and was struck down. Gustav fought alone until his Azure Core cracked, sealing them all inside the Tower's resonance field. GoD absorbed their energy, using them as living conduits to slowly consume the Monuments from within.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box critical">
                    <h4>🔴 The Current Crisis</h4>
                    <p>
                        In 30 days, the heroes' essence will be completely absorbed. If Azure disappears, Celestial blessings will vanish, and the long-sealed Demon Clan will reawaken. The Azure Knight's mission is to reignite all nine monuments before total absorption occurs.

                <p>
                    The world of Minar operates on a critical 30-day countdown. Each day represents a unit of potential progress or decay. The deadline appears in Chapter 2 after completing the first city's Main Quest.

                <h3>Azure Resonance Theory</h3>
                <p>
                    Scholars of Dellastro describe Azure not as magic, but as <strong>universal frequency</strong>—an oscillation between the physical and metaphysical. They classify it through three measurable attributes:
                </p>

                <div class="theory-grid">
                    <div class="theory-card">
                        <h4>Amplitude</h4>
                        <p>The strength of will</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="theory-card">
                        <h4>Frequency</h4>
                        <p>The purity of thought</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="theory-card">
                        <h4>Phase</h4>
                        <p>Alignment with Celestial Flame</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Together, these determine an individual's <strong>Resonance Index</strong>, reflecting their harmony with existence. When two beings' frequencies align, their memories can merge, creating telepathy, healing, or probability alteration. When frequencies clash, <strong>Azure Drift</strong> occurs—a corruption that spreads like disease.

                <p>
                    Azure Knights employs a <strong>multi-timeline convergence</strong> narrative structure inspired by Legend of Mana. Each city presents three parallel stories that occur simultaneously in the world, but the player can only focus on one character per arc.

                <ol class="narrative-steps">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Initial Exposure:</strong> Upon entering a new city, players witness brief introductory scenes for all three main characters, establishing their conflicts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Character Selection:</strong> Through exploration and side quests, players naturally gravitate toward one character. When their Main Quest triggers, this becomes the focus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Locked Focus:</strong> Once committed to a character's Main Quest, the other two continue their stories off-screen. Their fates unfold independently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Parallel Outcomes:</strong> Players learn about unchosen characters through rumors, letters, and environmental storytelling.

                    <div class="pillar">

                        <p>Every major story arc focuses on personal conflict rather than world-ending threats. The fate of Minar hangs in the balance, but the heart of each tale is human.</p>
